The ChronoVault project is a sophisticated and customizable backup management system designed to automate and streamline the process of creating periodic backups for critical files and directories. 
Tailored for both personal and professional use, it provides users with the flexibility to configure various aspects of the backup process through a simple yet powerful interface. Here's an overview of its key features and functionalities:

Configurable Source and Destination: Users can specify the source directory to monitor and backup, as well as the destination directory where the backups are stored. This allows for a tailored backup solution that fits specific needs.
Selective File Type Backup: ChronoVault supports the backing up of specific file types, enabling users to focus on important data and exclude unnecessary files, thereby optimizing storage usage.
Incremental Backup Support: With an option to backup only modified files, the system ensures efficient use of storage by avoiding duplicate backups of unchanged data, making it ideal for frequent backup operations.
Subfolder Inclusion: Users have the option to include subfolders in the backup process, ensuring a comprehensive backup of all directories and subdirectories within the source path.
Backup Rotation and Limits: To manage storage space effectively, ChronoVault allows users to set a maximum number of backups to retain, automatically rotating out the oldest backups when the limit is reached.
Flexible Scheduling: Backups can be scheduled at fixed intervals, allowing for regular and automatic updating of the backup repository without manual intervention.
Pause and Resume Capability: Users can temporarily pause the backup process, providing flexibility during high resource usage periods or when modifications to the backup configuration are needed.
Restore Functionality: ChronoVault includes a straightforward mechanism for restoring files from backups, making it easy to recover lost or corrupted data.
Developed in C#, the project showcases a robust use of threading for background operations, file I/O for managing backup data, and user interaction through the console for setting up and controlling the backup process. 
Its architecture is designed for easy expansion and customization, catering to a wide range of backup scenarios from personal projects to enterprise-level data management.
